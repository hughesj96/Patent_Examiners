## Examining the Examiners

#### John Hughes

This project is an analysis of how the patent examiner can impact the process and cause delays in patent pendency. It also looks at what adverse effects this may have on future patent performance. Analysis performed is a mix of visual analytics and regression models. 

### Requirements

This code was done in a Python 3 jupyter notebook, the following packages are required to be installed in order to carry this analysis out on your own machine:

pandas <br>
numpy <br>
sklearn <br>
recordlinkage <br>
statsmodels <br>
matplotlib <br>

These can all be installed in the command line on your machine with the installation instructions varying by machine, for example this author installs using 'pip install pandas'

### Workflow

The notebook follows the order of the project, starting with collecting that data, then creating and cleaning the dataframes, followed by visual analysis, and finally our regression models. Each cell has comments explaining further what we are doing at each specific step


```python
